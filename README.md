# HiveGUI
HiveGUI will run any compression tools that you add to hivegui.ini.

It was primarily created as a frontend for [flamewing's](https://github.com/flamewing) [mdcomp](https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp), but will work with anything that has input and output parameters. This includes even things that have nothing to do with compression.

HiveGUI can also process folders as well as invividual files.
